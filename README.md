## How It Works

### Resume Tailoring
The app uses three AI functions to enhance your resume:

1. **Professional Summary** - Rewrites your summary to be concise and impactful (max 3 sentences)
2. **Work Experience** - Rewrites bullet points to match keywords from the job description
3. **Projects** - Enhances project descriptions to highlight impact and technology

All tailoring happens locally on your machine via Ollama—your data never leaves your computer.

### Cover Letter Generation
AI generates a personalized cover letter that:
- Introduces you with enthusiasm and confidence
- Maps your skills to job requirements
- Includes a strong call to action
- Stays under 500 words

### PDF Generation
Uses ReportLab to create professionally formatted documents with:
- Clean typography
- Proper spacing and alignment
- All your sections (summary, skills, experience, projects, education)

## File Structure

```
.
├── app.py              # Main Streamlit application
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Dependencies

- **streamlit** - Web application framework
- **reportlab** - PDF generation
- **requests** - HTTP client for Ollama API

## Troubleshooting

**"Could not connect to Ollama"**
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
